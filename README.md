# Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to create a calculator that could calculate a user's net worth given a set of parameters. We are also required to create an optimized version of the networth calculation. Thre is no user validation because we were told not to authenticate, but I wanted to have user's so information could be reused.

# Use
This backend code set up all of the API calls the frontend used to create and access data stored in User's profiles & calculation used in charts on the frontend.

# Tools
Code was written in C# using the .Net framework. MongoDB was used as our database solution.
